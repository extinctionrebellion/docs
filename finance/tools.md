# Tools

### Google Spreadsheet

Probably the most versatile tool out there. Perfect to get started and much better than Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to share publicly and work together on it.

Exemples:

* [XR Tower and Hamlets expenses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mjOjGr8ZjCCJkGfLZ5lZU342KCbS105o1oCjsu4IdkU/edit#gid=0)

## Open Collective

It's a tool to collect and disburse money for your local group in a transparent way. It offers a simple way to upload expenses with a picture of the receipt or invoice and a simple approval process.

### Cost

If you already have a bank account, you can use Open Collective for free. There is just a 5% commission if you decide to accept donations by credit card \(on top of the [Stripe fees](http://stripe.com/pricing)\). For donations made by bank transfer, there is no commission. You just need to record them on the platform manually.

If you don’t have a bank account, Open Collective can offer fiscal sponsorship in the [UK](https://opencollective.com/uk), in [Europe](https://opencollective.com/europe) and in the [US](https://opencollective.com/foundation) for a 10% fee on all donations. This takes care of the accounting / book keeping.

If you've already created a non profit entity in your country, you can also use it to be a fiscal sponsor for other local groups in your region \(and save them the pain and the cost of creating and maintaining a legal entity\).

Given that the platform is [open source](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective), you could also fork the code and install it on your own server, in which case it’s entirely free \(but a lot of work\).

### Can I use another crowdfunding platform with open collective?

Yes. Even though Open Collective lets you directly raise money on the platform \(for a 5% fee + credit card fees\), you don't have to use that feature. You can use any other crowdfunding platform out there and then add the proceeds to your open collective. In that case there is no fee \(well, just the fees of the crowdfunding platform that you would be using\). That's what XR Hackney has been doing. They use Chuffed.org for their fundraising.
