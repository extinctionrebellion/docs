# Offline fundraising

## Meetings

It's always a good idea to pass a donation box. Just make sure to share the message that it is optional. Nobody should ever feel pressured to donate to attend an XR meeting.

## Talks

At the talk of Roger Hallam in Brussels \(August 2019\), we passed a donation box –church style– and we collected €275 \(with about 170 people in the room\).

## Food

> "From Bristol's experience, I can't stress the importance of food and block printing/general arts and crafts activities. Regardless of what event you're doing, having some free food will make people 10x more likely to donate and donate more."  
> – James \(XR Bristol\)
