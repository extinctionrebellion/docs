# Online fundraising

## Requirements

To be able to collect money online, you first need a legal person. This could be an individual, an unincorporated partnership \(aka unincorporated club or association of people\) or a legal entity \(typically a non profit or a limited liability company, aka LLC\).

Alternatively, you can also ask an existing legal entity to act as your Fiscal Sponsor. That basically means that you use an existing entity to collect money on your behalf. You can later ask them to disburse the money for various expenses that you have.
