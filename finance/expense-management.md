# Expense management

Transparency is important, especially when it comes to money. 

## How we do it at XR Belgium

We are using [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com). See [https://opencollective.com/XR-Belgium](https://opencollective.com/XR-Belgium)

People can donate money online or by bank transfer. Every time anyone needs money \(for supplies and material, renting a place for our general assemblies, etc.\), they simply submit the expense or the invoice of the vendor to the collective. All expenses are public and transparent \(see [https://opencollective.com/XR-belgium/expenses](https://opencollective.com/XR-belgium/expenses)\).

We can also export all the data in CSV and via their [API](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/api).

Other XR chapters already on Open Collective:

* [XR Hackney](https://opencollective.com/xrhackney)
* [XR Waltham Forest](https://opencollective.com/extinction-rebellion-waltham-forest1)
* [XR Barcelona](https://opencollective.com/xr-barcelona)
* [XR Namur](https://opencollective.com/xr-namur)

### Cost

If you already have a bank account, you can use Open Collective for free. There is just a 5% commission if you decide to accept donations by credit card \(on top of the [Stripe fees](http://stripe.com/pricing)\). For donations made by bank transfer, there is no commission. You just need to record them on the platform manually.

If you don’t have a bank account, Open Collective can offer fiscal sponsorship in the UK, in Europe and in the US for a 10% fee on all donations. This takes care of the accounting / book keeping.

If you've already created a non profit entity in your country, you can also use it to be a fiscal sponsor for other local groups in your region \(and save them the pain and the cost of creating and maintaining a legal entity\).

Given that the platform is [open source](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective), you could also fork the code and install it on your own server, in which case it’s entirely free \(but a lot of work\).

### Can I use another crowdfunding platform with open collective?

Yes, it’s not mutually exclusive. You can use any other crowdfunding platform out there and then add the proceeds to your open collective. In that case there is no fee \(well, just the fees of the crowdfunding platform that you would be using\).

### How to create an open collective for your own local group?

### About Open Collective

It’s an [open source platform](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective) mostly used in the open source community to enable [open source projects](https://opencollective.com/opensource) to receive and use money collectively and in a very transparent way \(see [a new way to fund open source projects](https://medium.com/open-collective/a-new-way-to-fund-open-source-projects-91a51b1b7aac)\).

It’s also used by networks such as Women Who Code which has 83 chapters around the world. It makes it easy to distribute funds from the global movement down to the different chapters that need money. It also enables local chapters to share one single legal entity so that accounting / legal can be mutualized and each local chapter can focus on their mission.
