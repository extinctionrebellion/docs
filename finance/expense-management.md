# Expense management

Transparency is important, especially when it comes to money. 

## How we do it at XR Belgium

We are using [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com). See [https://opencollective.com/XR-Belgium](https://opencollective.com/XR-Belgium)

People can donate money online or by bank transfer. Every time anyone needs money \(for supplies and material, renting a place for our general assemblies, etc.\), they simply submit the expense or the invoice of the vendor to the collective. All expenses are public and transparent \(see [https://opencollective.com/XR-belgium/expenses](https://opencollective.com/XR-belgium/expenses)\).

We can also export all the data in CSV and via their [API](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/developers/api).
