# Welcome

## Who is this for?

This documentation is meant for any rebel that wants to start a new local chapter of XR in their region / city, a new affinity group or a dedicated working group.

You don't have to have any prior experience with self organizing systems \(SOS\). We will walk you through the different concepts along the way when needed.

## Who is maintaining it?

* Leen Schelfhout \(XR Antwerp\) \([email](mailto:leen.schelfhout@protonmail.com)\)
* Xavier Damman \(XR UK Fundraising, XR Belgium\) \([email](mailto:citizenspring@protonmail.com)\)

Please join us. Our goal is to hand it over as soon as possible to the community.

If you have created a local chapter or a working group, please share your experience and contribute to this book. It's interesting to hear about many different stories and the different ways rebels have organized themselves. You can [edit any of those pages on Github](https://github.com/extinctionrebellion/docs).
