# Welcome

## Who is this for?

This documentation is meant for any rebel that wants to start a new local chapter of XR in their region / city, a new affinity group or a dedicated working group.

You don't have to have any prior experience with self organizing systems \(SOS\). We will walk you through the different concepts along the way when needed.

## Contribute

If you have created a local chapter or a working group, please share your experience and contribute to this book. It's interesting to hear about many different stories and the different ways rebels have organized themselves. Send an email to info@xr-docs.opencollective.com
