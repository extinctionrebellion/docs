# Principles and values

**Any person or group can organise autonomously and take action in the name and spirit of XR so long as the action fits within XRâ€™s principles and values. In this way, power is decentralised, meaning that there is no need to ask for permission from a central group or authority.**

1. **We have a shared vision of change** creating a world that is fit for generations to come. 
2. **We set our mission on what is necessary** using momentum-driven organising to mobilise the population and achieve system change. 
3. **We need a regenerative culture** creating a culture which is healthy, resilient and adaptable. 
4. **We openly challenge ourselves and this toxic system** leaving our comfort zones to take action for change. 
5. **We value reflecting and learning** following a cycle of action, reflection, learning, and planning for more action. Learning from other movements and contexts as well as our own experiences. 
6. **We welcome everyone and every part of everyone** working actively to create safer and more accessible spaces. 
7. **We actively mitigate for power** breaking down hierarchies of power for more equitable participation. 
8. **We avoid blaming and shaming** we live in a toxic system, but no one individual is to blame. 
9. **We are a non-violent network** using non-violent strategy and tactics as the most effective way to bring about change. 
10. **We are based on autonomy and decentralisation** we collectively create the structures we need to challenge power.
