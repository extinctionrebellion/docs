# Principles and values

### we have a shared vision of change

Creating a world that is fit for generations to come.

### we set our mission on what is necessary

Mobilising 3.5% of the population to achieve system change - using ideas such as "Momentum-driven organising" to achieve this.

### we need a regenerative culture

Creating a culture which is healthy, resilient and adaptable.

### we openly challenge ourselves and our toxic system

Leaving our comfort zones to take action for change.

### we value reflecting and learning

Following a cycle of action, reflection, learning, and planning for more action. Learning from other movements and contexts as well as our own experiences.

### we welcome everyone and every part of everyone

Working actively to create safer and more accessible spaces.

### we actively mitigate for power

Breaking down hierarchies of power for more equitable participation.

### we avoid blaming and shaming

We live in a toxic system, but no one individual is to blame.

### we are a non-violent network

Using non-violent strategy and tactics as the most effective way to bring about change.

### we are based on autonomy and decentralisation

We collectively create the structures we need to challenge power. Anyone who follows these core principles and values can take action in the name of Extinction Rebellion.
