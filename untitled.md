# Create a local chapter

## What is a local chapter?

A local chapter is a local group of XR. Every group operate autonomously and connect with neighbor groups, national / regional / international groups at will and only when needed. There is no hierarchy.

The goal of a local chapter is to create a local presence all around the world for rebels to meet and organise actions of civil disobedience for the climate.
