# Raising money for legal costs

Many UK chapters use CrowdJustice as an online platform to raise money. Mike from UK Legal has written this [useful guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ktCw6w1j_NNOT4UgtfIgr3dEwSlhD5NGbydEQQYjFyg/edit#heading=h.w6o85qv1yip2) on how to set up CrowdJustice for your local group.

A few important notes:

* you can't guarantee that you will cover the fines of someone who got arrested. Otherwise, their fine might get higher. But once a rebel has received a fine, you can case by case and budget allowing, consider covering it in all or in part.
* if you don't have a bank account yet, you can use a central XR UK bank account \(see in the document\)
