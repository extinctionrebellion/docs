# Raising money for legal costs

Many UK chapters use CrowdJustice as an online platform to raise money. Mike from UK Legal has written this [useful guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ktCw6w1j_NNOT4UgtfIgr3dEwSlhD5NGbydEQQYjFyg/edit#heading=h.w6o85qv1yip2) on how to set up CrowdJustice for your local group.

A few important notes:

* you can't guarantee that you will cover the fines of someone who got arrested. Otherwise, their fine might get higher. But once a rebel has received a fine, you can case by case and budget allowing, consider covering it in all or in part.
* if you don't have a bank account yet, you can use a central XR UK bank account \(see in the document\)

This is what Evin from XR Hackney had to say about [their campaign on CrowdJustice](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/xr-hackney/):

> We just set a stretch target of £1,000 per arrestee so 8k total. Their actual legal costs could be more like £2k each, but we just don’t know.
>
> The first hours and day are crucial. Having the list of 10-20 people donate immediately really helped. We had £1,700 in first hour and around £3,000 by end of first day. After that it tails off, we got £200 today, so £3,200 from 90+ people in total. That was from going out to a mailing list of 1,700 members.
>
> So aiming for a target of at least 5% of however many members you send it out to donating an average of £30 each seems like one way you could estimate a realistic goal.
