# Opening a bank account

Many XR chapters in the UK opened an account with the [Triodos Bank](https://www.triodos.co.uk/) \(XR Bristol, XR Tower Hamlets, Bath, Totnes, ...\)

This is what Rosetta from XR Bristol had to say:

> We began looking at them because they are the most social-ethical bank in the UK, the main central XR account is with them, they are UK based, have a good reputation and customer service.  
>   
> They have a Social Venture account that caters for not-for-profit organisations. You donâ€™t need to be a registered business or charity or named individual\(s\).  
>   
> We like the idea that the account fees are used for social-ethical purposes and put back into communities.

XR Bristol has made this great document outlining the steps to create such bank [https://xrbristol.org.uk/bank-accounts/](https://xrbristol.org.uk/bank-accounts/)
